# Orion

A vision and pose estimation system for FIRST Robotics Competition robots. Inspired by Team 6328's [Northstar](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2024/tree/main/vision/northstar) and Team 1678's fork of it, [Polaris](https://github.com/frc1678/C2024-Public/tree/main/polaris). 

Currently only tested on an Orange Pi 5 running Armbian Bookworm 24.5.5, with an Arducam OV9281 camera
